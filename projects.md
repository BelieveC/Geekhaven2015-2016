#Suggested Projects

* [Institute ticketing system] - In todays world, major enterprises adopt ticketing systems as their primary inter-teams communication channel for raising requests and mentioning issues. The system acts as a web portal with clear ownership of different clients to different ticket queues. This highly expedites transparency and efficiency of the enterprise communication. Such a system also empowers to define clear service level agreements(SLA) between different entites. For example, a request X by a team A to team B should take maximum 5 days to process.
Example Use Cases for college:
**Exam cell - Students: Instead of writing application for transcript and other things and then roaming multiple times, a ticket could be cut and a response can be received on request completion. A clear SLA of 1 week can be established making the exam cell accountable for any delays.
**Hostel Maintance - Students: All request for broken room accessories, room cleaning, unmaintained washrooms can pass on this channel giving clear monthly/weekly statistics which will enable evaluating performance of the maintaince staff.
**Administration: There are a numerous number of request raised between administration such as requirement of a file, preparation of a report, salary processing information, reimbursement claims etc. All these can be directed through this framework instead of writing applications and getting them manually signed by different entities.
